# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This sites store notes and other userful information pertaining to full stack web development.
It was made for the purpose of learning and practicing web development in all aspects.

Currently it's just a location for storing my notes, but eventually will be a full fledge site with fun quips and methods for studying, along with a link to my future portfolio.
Through the development of this site, I have learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, coding best practices, and version control via GitHub, alongside proper documentation and deployment methodologies.
